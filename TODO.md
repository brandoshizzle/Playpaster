## To Do

-   Add n first, push last n (1.5 hours)
-   Add tags to playlists (4 hours)
-   Add selected release after first album in playlist
-   Re-get playlist info button for each playlist
-   Show other songs in album re-order

## UI

-   Make left pannel ~1/2 the size so the right pannel stretches out causing each row to take up less vertical real estate
-   Click to expand description
-   Clicking on playlist title opens up new tab/window directing to the playlist URL
-   Instead of checkmark in checkbox, something rude and offensive like a butt or penis or something
-   Colours: dark greens, browns, hints of blue - It would be nice if it felt naturesque
-   Fart sounds when actions are done

## Maybe later

-   Confirm delete
-   Create new playlist

## Done

-   Albums listed as chips
-   Filter out playlists if they don't have LS songs or are empty
-   In-UI console
-   Playlist last update (in days)
-   Playlist length (in time)
-   Bold header row (i.e. "Name", "Description" etc.)
-   Bold Playlist name
-   Replace playlist albums
-   Input list of playlist urls from sheets and give back list of followers to paste back
-   Having the ability to paste in a column of playlist links and follow all of the ones I am currently not already following (1.5 hour)
-   Can you add a scroll bar to the album re-order
